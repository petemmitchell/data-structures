## Description
**Insertion Sort**

Insertion sort seems like a relatively simple concept when watching animations,
but sitting down and creating it for the first time was more challenging than I
expected. I definitely learned a new school, which is the art of looking at
complex sudo code provided by Wikipedia & sorting-algorithms.com and drawing it
out in order to understand the functions.

The result is a somewhat refactored and therefore fairly clean attempt at
insertion sort. I'm sure as I continue to create more sorting algorithms, I will
have a further opportunity to refactor and clean up. Current benchmarks:

-Best Case (already sorted intergers 1-5000)
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000409)
-Worst Case (reverse sorted intergers 5000-1)
  2.180000   0.000000   2.180000 (  2.183822)
-Random (shuffled intergers 1-5000)
  1.080000   0.000000   1.080000 (  1.083152)

**Merge Sort**
Coming soon.
